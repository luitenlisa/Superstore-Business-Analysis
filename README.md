### Project Overview 
In this project, I compiled some theoretical business questions to improve profitability for this superstore. The following questions were used as a guideline for this analysis:

Which factors contribute most to profit and loss on individual orders?

Are there customer or product segments where discounting is hurting more than helping?

Can we predict if an order is likely to be unprofitable?

How should marketing or pricing strategies differ by region?
