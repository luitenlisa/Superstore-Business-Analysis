### Project Overview 
In this project, I compiled some theoretical questions to improve profitability for this superstore. The following questions were used as a guideline for analysis:

Which factors contribute most to profit and loss on individual orders?

Can we predict if an order is likely to be unprofitable?

Are there customer or product segments where discounting is hurting more than helping?

How should marketing or pricing strategies differ by region?
